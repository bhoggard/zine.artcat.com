<p>According to our sources, David Yassky’s office is moving full steam ahead with the India Street mural project. Thanks to a seed donation of $8,000, the North Brooklyn Public Art Coalition is now accepting proposals for the huge concrete wall in between West Street and the East River in Greenpoint. The building is slated for demolition in Fall 2009, but in the meantime, NBPAC is eager to infuse the space with some public art. There are eleven artists, teachers, and even some India Street residents on Yassky’s panel. It’s a fairly open ended project, but they are looking specifically for art that celebrates arts in the community, so you’ll get points with panel members for keeping proposals family friendly. Still interested? Submission guidelines and applications are available <a href="http://www.councilmemberyassky.com/Request%20for%20Proposals-%20India%20Street%20Mural%20Project.pdf)">here</a>. </p>

<p>But hurry! Applications are due April 24th. </p>

<p>Rami Metal, from David Yassky’s office, who headed up the second NBPAC meeting, called the India Street mural initiative, “a kickoff project for the coalition…which will hopefully snowball into a lot more public art projects in the future.” So if murals aren’t your thing, feel free to contact Rami and NBPAC with a different proposal. Based on those attending tonight’s NBPAC meeting, the coalition is interested in anything from sound art to dance performances, as long as its accessible to the public, located in North Brooklyn, and, well, free. More info at Greenpointers, <a href="https://greenpointers.blogspot.com/2009/03/india-street-mural-project-calling.html">here</a>. </p>

The show features a panoply of works thematically and technically diverse in style and aggressively priced to sell for the coming holidays -- the low-end work starting at $75. The gallery will be closing for the holidays on Tuesday, 23 December.</p>

<p>A story reported here yesterday, and widely across New York media -- the occupation of the New School Graduate Faculty Building by students -- seems to have been largely resolved with what students describe as a <a href="http://www.newschoolinexile.com/agreement.html">"major victory<br />
over university administration."</a></p>

<p>ArtCal Zine will be suspending posting for the New Year at some point early in the next week. We'll resume in early January.</p>

Eyebeam - 540 W. 21st St.</p>

<p>Deitch Projects' Art Parade has been canceled due to a severe storm warning. Instead, head down to Eyebeam for a fashion-week inspired performance by Ayah Bdeir. Bdeir will hold a runway show of her and Luma Shihab-Eldin's Syrian-style technologically hacked lingerie on the street in front of Eyebeam, where she is currently a fellow. Having grown up between Lebanon, Canada, and the US, Bdier recruits technology to investigate (and indict) kitsch orientalism, and popular representations of the middle east. Her work has included<a href="http://ayahbdeir.com/about.html"> "interactive installations, electronic fashion, gadgets, [and] reactive furniture."</a> The performance on offer tomorrow appears to detour the post-feminist profiteering that is the sexy-undies industry in a sly critique of the high-minded, if sometimes oblique, patronizing of Islamic women by their more liberated western counterparts. </p>

            <p>After a week of intensive art fair coverage on our parallel <a href="https://zine.artcat.com/armory2008/">fair blog</a>, we're pleased to post <a href="https://zine.artcat.com/armory2008/2008/04/big-dumb-and-beautiful.php">Brent Burket's scattershot impressions of The Armory Show</a>. An excerpt follows:</p>

<blockquote>
I always pay attention when I'm unusually hungry for a certain piece of music. It always reveals a little bit about where my head and heart are residing in a given moment. Crossing 9th Avenue on my way to the Armory I was overcome by the desire to listen to the biggest and dumbest song I could find on my iPod, Fish's live version of The Heart of Lothian. Turned out that having the barrel-chested Scotsman in my ears was a perfect way to prepare for the annual goofy-ass grandness of the Armory. Onward!</blockquote>

<p><i>Rice and Beans</i><br />
Alison Knowles and Charles Curtis<br />
7:30 Tuesday 25 March 2008<br />
Miguel Abreu Gallery - 36 Orchard Street New York, NY</p>

<p>Tomorrow nigt at the Miguel Abreu Gallery, founding Fluxus member Alison Knowles will be presenting <i>Rice and Beans</i>, a new musical performance in collaboration with composer Charles Curtis who will be performing the piece. Alison Knowles writes:</p>

<blockquote>
 I will do a poem titled <i>Mantra for Jessie (some help in sleeping)</i>. It is a juxtaposition of sound and color in a literal narrative poem. In my mind it is a lullaby. I remember Simone Forti my friend in California who says her mother used to read her recipes to put her to sleep. This Mantra appears in a pamphlet put out by the Great Bear series of Something Else Press, 1979. The pamphlet is titled <i>More by Alison Knowles</i>.

<p>Charles will play a score I made for him entitled <i>Rice and Beans for Charles Curtis</i>. He will also play a pieces by John Cage and Morton Feldman from the 1950s.</p>

<p>Lentils were eaten from the wild before domestication. They are the oldest bean in existence first found in the Franchthi Caves of Greece in 1,100 B.C. They appeared in the Bronze Age and then India and Ethiopia as well. Beans are the first food associated with the poor. Documents in tablet form with recipes have been discovered, but most recently in a rock crevice on cliffs off the Pacific coast what may be an ancient vestment has appeared. Its origins are completely unknown. It is made of paper melded with muslin containing red lentils, a tangle of cords and black curled marks perhaps some primitive language. Egyptians imagined it was sufficient to eat lentils to enlighten the mind and open the heart, and perhaps as well to make music!</blockquote></p>

<p>Here at ArtCal we seek out under recognized and under represented galleries and venues for contemporary art, specifically promoting the best emerging talent from those fields. Launched November 18th, 2004, what began as a listing service has seen significant growth over the last three and a half years.  In 2005 we added images to the site's features, as well as RSS and iCal feeds.  At the time, no other art listing website offered such tools, so I imagine the technology made heavy Internet users extraordinarily happy; as an active blogger it certainly made my life a lot easier.  ArtCal continued in its Internet pioneering only a few months later hiring me as their listings editor - clearly a high point in their services!  Since that time, we launched our newsletter on March 30th, 2006, our beautiful redesign on August 28th 2007, and most recently, ArtCal Zine, the flagship event and reviews publication which debuted on October 4th, 2007.</p>

<p>As ArtCal embarked on 2008 we asked our readers to tell us a little bit more about themselves, and are now ready announce our findings.  Through the course of this survey we learned a number of interesting facts, not the least of which is that you all go to a lot of openings!  Of those polled, only 5.2% said they didn't go to any receptions at all, where as 50% said they attended at least 1-3 each month, and 31% attend 5-10.  13.3% of you seem to have lives solely centering around openings and arrive at more than 10 throughout the course of 30 days.</p>

<div class="image-left"><a href="https://zine.artcat.com/upload/2008/02/ArtCalSurvey2.jpg"><img src="https://zine.artcat.com/upload/2008/02/ArtCalSurvey2.jpg" width="300" alt="ArtCal Survey Results"/></a><div class="photo-caption"></div></div>

<p>ArtCal subscribers tell us that while they use a large number of publications to keep abreast of art openings, over 80% rely on email announcements to inform them of openings.  Let this be a warning to all you who have blogs and assume you've told your friends merely by posting an event notice. It turns out email is still the most effective means of reaching an audience, and certainly a good reason to subscribe to our weekly newsletter if you haven't already. Nearly 43.3 percent of our audience have post graduate degrees, closely followed by those 32% with college degrees.  We also suspect most of you are sexy, though SurveyMonkey.com has no scientific means of measuring this, except to tell us that 62.5% of our readers are between the ages of 25 and 44.  Generally speaking that age bracket is hot, so congratulations everyone who hits that mark.  Also congratulations are in order to the 42.8% of you who live in Manhattan.  As a member of the 26.6% of Brooklyn dwellers, I look enviously upon you.  Interestingly 11.6% of our readership lives outside the United States, which I think indicates an extremely invested demographic in the arts.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, it should not go unmentioned that an extremely high percentage of our readership are also collectors.  Of those surveyed, over 49% said they planned to fill their homes with art.  Given that 94% of our readers attend one or more openings per month, that we receive over 103,500 page views over that same time period, and that our audience is largely made up of upper middle class well educated readers, we are undoubtedly a desirable, and influential bunch.  We are also growing.  ArtCal newsletter subscribers hit 2000 in January, a number that continues to climb.  Based on your feedback we will be adding a number of new features over the course of the next few months. Our aim as always, is to build upon and improve a service we're already really proud to offer all of you. </p>
